# LitenVM: A Small Stack-based Virtual Machine in C

This is a minimalistic stack-based virtual machine written in C called *LitenVM* (*liten* means small in Swedish). *LitenVM* is similar to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but it has a much smaller instruction set, with only 22 different instructions. Additionally, *LitenVM* supports various features including strings, integer arithmetic, conditional and unconditional jumps, method calls, and subtype polymorphism. It also includes built-in support for native classes and methods, which can be utilized for string concatenation and console output. However, *LitenVM* lacks certain features that are essential for a commercial-grade virtual machine in today's world, such as a garbage collector, just-in-time compiler, and bytecode verifier to prevent the execution of dangerous code.
